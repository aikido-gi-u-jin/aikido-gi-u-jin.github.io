#### Development

Built using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)

To get started...

```
gem install bundler
gem install middleman
bundle install
middleman server
```

Sources are in ```/source``` and the site is compiled to ```/build```.

Please make changes on the ```authors``` branch.

Deploy by running ```middleman deploy```.  This builds the site and force pushes ```/build``` to the ```master``` branch.
